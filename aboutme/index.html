    <p> <font size="6">Hi! I am Victor Jared Onato, other people here like to call me "kulot" (meaning curly hair in our language). I live in the Philippines and I am 24 years old. </p>
    <p>I am pursuing to become a software developer because I am fascinated in coding. When I was younger than I am right now I have a dream of becoming a medical doctor,
        but when I have seen the movie "Live Free or Die Hard" I was amazed on the character who was the hacker in that movie and since then I have been wanting to do the same.
        Of course I won't do something that will cause harm to others.
    </p>
    <p>My hobbies are reading fictional books like Harry Potter, Percy Jackson and the Olympians, and Heroes of Olympus. 
        I like listening to music that calms my mind (I don't know the genre but I just search medieval songs). I also like playing videogames
        and that is also another reason I want to explore coding because I also want to be a part of a gaming company. 
    </p>
    <p>If you have questions don't hesitate to ask. </font></p>
